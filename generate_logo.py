    Design a modern, clean logo for "KidBrowser" - a safe YouTube browser for children.

    Style Requirements:
    - Modern, minimal design with rounded corners and soft edges
    - Professional yet family-friendly aesthetic
    - Clean typography with the brand name "KidBrowser"
    - Primary color: Light red (#ef4444) with subtle gradients to darker red (#dc2626)
    - White background or transparent background
    - Simple, memorable icon that represents both browsing/technology and child safety
    - Should work well at small sizes (40x40px) and large sizes
    - Avoid overly cartoonish elements - aim for a trustworthy, modern tech company feel
    - Color palette similar to Notion's soft, muted red tones

    Icon Concepts (choose one):
    - A browser window with a shield overlay
    - A stylized "K" or "KB" monogram with protective elements
    - A simplified browser tab with child-safe elements
    - A clean compass or navigation symbol representing safe browsing

    The logo should convey:
    - Trust and safety for parents
    - Modern technology and reliability
    - Child-friendly without being too playful
    - Professional software company quality

    Format: Square logo that can be used as a favicon and header logo.
    Style: Modern SaaS company aesthetic, similar to Notion, Linear, or Figma branding with soft, muted colors.
