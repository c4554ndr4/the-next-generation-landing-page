    <h1>Scout Browser Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 2025</p>

    <div class="notice">
        <h3>Important Notice</h3>
        <p><strong>Scout Browser is an independent, third-party application and is not affiliated with, endorsed, or sponsored by YouTube or Google.</strong> It is designed as a tool for parents to manage their children's YouTube viewing experience. No filtering technology is 100% accurate, and parental supervision remains essential.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Scout Browser is designed with privacy in mind and collects minimal information necessary to provide the service:</p>

        <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> Your application settings and content filtering preferences, stored locally on your device</li>
        <li><strong>Basic Usage Analytics:</strong> Anonymous technical information to improve application performance and stability</li>

    <p>Your privacy and security are our priorities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All user preferences and settings are stored locally on your device</li>
        <li><strong>Temporary Processing:</strong> Content analysis data is processed securely and temporarily when AI analysis is requested</li>
        <li><strong>No Permanent Storage:</strong> We do not permanently store video content, viewing history, or personal information on our servers</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Transmission:</strong> All data transmission uses HTTPS encryption</li>
        <li><strong>No Data Sharing:</strong> We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>

        <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> Content filtering happens locally whenever possible</li>
        <li><strong>No Behavioral Tracking:</strong> We do not track or profile children's viewing behavior</li>
    </ul>
